# ROFL ðŸŽŸ

A full stack web3 application built for anyone who wants to raffle off their beloved jpegs.


## Why we Built This

After being a part of one of the most extensive bull markets in world-history, my buddies and I were amazed by how these marketplace wars have played out. Now don't get us wrong, we love our airdrops, but we just feel like there's a way tpo make this all a little more... fun. ROFL is the first public good, P2P raffle platform on the Ethereum Network.
